# phpWebFTP

This is a fork of the original [phpWebFTP on SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpwebftp/)
The project has been found abandoned for some while and not compatible to PHP5.

The goal is to provide a refurbished and working version of phpWebFTP to meet
today's needs and possibilities.
